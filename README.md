# Hello people of the universe! ✨

This is a ['Space Invaders'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) type of game written in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) for Kood/Jõhvi.

It failed the audit but it's still fun to play.

## How to play

To play the game open the index.html file OR go to this [link]().

The game is simple! Try to stay alive for as long as possible and destroy as many space invaders as you can.

### Controls

Use the Arrow Keys to move, and the Spacebar to shoot! The Escape key can be used to toggle pause (unpause and pause) at any time!
